                The national monitoring program was initiated by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and is now financed by the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management.    
            - >
                Monitoring is performed by Umeå University. Data are stored in the Swedish Ocean Archive (SHARK) by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI).

                Data should be sampled and analyzed according to the HELCOM COMBINE Manual - Part C Annex C11 Guidelines concerning bacterioplankton growth determination (https://helcom.fi/media/documents/Manual-for-Marine-Monitoring-in-the-COMBINE-Programme-of-HELCOM_PartC_AnnexC11.pdf). However, deviations from the manual might occur. Information about the
                program and the methods are available in Swedish at the website of Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management, https://www.havochvatten.se/hav/vagledning--lagar/vagledningar/ovriga-vagledningar/undersokningstyper-for-miljoovervakning/undersokningstyper/bakteriell-syrekonsumtion.html

            description:
                '"It is recommended to take at least 2 samples at different representative depths of the monitored layers of the water column. 
                Surface layer and deepest layer are prioritised. [...] A sampling frequency of 10 samples per year is required to get confident annual estimates (J. Wikner, unpubl. results). 
                Samples should be distributed in the seasonal curve to provide a good coverage of different levels (more samples during the productive season)"
