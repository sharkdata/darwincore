    title: SHARK - National marine bacterioplankton monitoring in Sweden since 1989

    abstract: 
        para: 
            - Bacterioplankton has been monitored in Sweden since 1989. 
              The national monitoring program was initiated by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and is now financed by the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management. 
            - Monitoring is performed by Umeå University. 
              Data are stored in the Swedish Ocean Archive (SHARK) database by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI). 
            - Data are collected and analyzed according to the Helcom COMBINE Manual - Part C Annex C11 Guidelines concerning bacterioplankton growth determination or simular methods. 
            - Bacterioplankton growth rate is an indicator of the nutrient status in aquatic environments. 
              It is an estimate of the consumption of organic carbon in the ecosystem and therefore closely related to the biochemical oxygen demand in situ (cf. BOD7). 
              Bacterioplankton growth rate thereby indicates the rate of oxygen consumption that may lead to oxygen deficiency in the water column when exceeding oxygen supply.

        sampling: 
            description:
                It is recommended to take at least 2 samples at different representative depths of the monitored layers of the water column. 
                Surface layer and deepest layer are prioritised... 
                A sampling frequency of 10 samples per year is required to get confident annual estimates (J. Wikner, unpubl. results). 
                Samples should be distributed in the seasonal curve to provide a good coverage of different levels (more samples during the productive season)
