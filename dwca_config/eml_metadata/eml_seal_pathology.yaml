    title: SHARK - National marine environmental monitoring of Seal pathology in Sweden

    abstract:
        para:
            - Seal pathology using necropsy and histopathological findings of dead seals has been monitored in and
              around Swedish coasts since 2008. The  monitoring program was initiated and financed by the
              Swedish Environmental Protection Agency.
            - Monitoring is performed by the Swedish Museum of Natural History.
            - Data is stored in the Swedish archive for oceanographic data (SHARK) database, curated by SMHI.
            - Seals constitute an important part of pelagic food webs as top predators and their health is essential
              for maintaining a good ecosystem balance. These organisms are at the highest trophic level and can be
              used as proxy for harmful substances since these compounds are stored in the body fat (adipose tissue)
              and organs of the animals.
            - This monitoring program is focused toward determining the health status of
              seal populations via autopsies of animals that are collected and sent to  the Swedish Museum of Natural History.
              In addition, the program is also aimed for finding and measuring potentially harmful substances in biota.
            - Sampling provides information to describe the cause of death among seals.
            - "Data is collected and analyzed according to methods described by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency
              (http://www.naturvardsverket.se/upload/stod-i-miljoarbetet/vagledning/miljoovervakning/handledning/metoder/undersokningstyper/kust-hav/patologi-hos-grasal-vikare-sal-och-knubbsal-ver-1-1-2014-03-19.pdf).
              If the exact position of the findings are not known, the position will be stored as the county town of the county in which the seal was found."
