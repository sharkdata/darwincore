    title: SHARK - National marine environmental monitoring of Epibenthos in Sweden since 1992

    abstract:
        para:
            - The monitoring program was initiated by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and later the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management took over the responsibility and financing of the program.
            - The monitoring is performed by Stockholm University, University of Gothenburg and Linnaeus University.
            - The data is stored in the database SHARK, hosted and maintained by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute.
            - The epibenthos monitoring program studies hard and soft bottoms from the surface down to 10-20 meters.
            - Data is collected in transects or squares with help of divers.
            - Species abundances are determined directly by the divers or photographs/video are taken and analyzed later.
            - Field notes are in Swedish.
