    title: SHARK - National Epibenthos monitoring in Sweden since 1992

    abstract: 
        para: 
            - Epibenthos has been nationally monitored in Sweden since 1992. 
            - The monitoring program was initiated by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency 
              and later the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management took over the responsibility and financing of the program. 
            - The monitoring is performed by Stockholm University, University of Gothenburg and Linnaeus University. 
            - The data is stored in the database SHARK, hosted and maintained by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. 
            - The epibenthos monitoring program studies hard and soft bottoms from the surface down to 10-20 meters. 
            - Data is collected in transects or squares with help of divers. 
            - Species abundances are determined directly by the divers or photographs/video are taken and analyzed later. 
            - Field notes are in Swedish. 
            - More information is available in Swedish at https://www.havochvatten.se/hav/samordning--fakta/miljoovervakning/miljoovervakningens-programomrade-kust-och-hav/delprogram-vegetationskladda-bottnar.html
