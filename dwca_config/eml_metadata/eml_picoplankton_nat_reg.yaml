    abstract:
        para:
            - The national monitoring program was initiated by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and is now financed by the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management.
            - Monitoring is performed by Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute and Umeå University
            - "Data are stored in the Swedish Ocean Archive database (SHARK), by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. Data should be sampled and analyzed according to MacIsaac E A and Stockner J G 1993. Enumeration of phototrophic picoplankton by autoflourescence microscopy. In Handbook of methods in aquatic microbial ecology. Kemp P F, Sherr B F, Sherr E B, and Cole J J (eds.) Lewis, Boca Raton. pp. 187-197. However, deviations from the manual might occur. Information about the program and the methods are available in Swedish at the website of Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management, https://www.havochvatten.se/overvakning-och-uppfoljning/miljoovervakning/organisation-och-programomraden/miljoovervakningens-programomrade-kust-och-hav/delprogram-fria-vattenmassan.html, and at https://helcom.fi/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/HELCOM-Guidelines-for-monitoring-of-phytoplankton-species-composition-abundance-and-biomass.pdf and https://www.ospar.org/documents?d=35398."
