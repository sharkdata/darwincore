    abstract:
        para:
            - The monitoring is financed by the Swedish county administration boards, Swedish municipalities and Swedish coalitions of water conservation. Recipient control data financed by companies are also included.
              Monitoring is performed by Swedish universities and consulting firms.
            - "Data are stored in the Swedish Ocean Archive database (SHARK), by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. Data are collected and analyzed according to the
              HELCOM COMBINE Manual - Part C Annex C6 Monitoring of phytoplankton species composition, abundance and biomass (https://www.helcom.fi/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Guidelines-for-monitoring-phytoplankton-species-composition-abundance-and-biomass.pdf) or similar methods. "
            - "In short, analysis of phytoplankton species composition, abundance and biomass is carried out for the following purposes
              - to describe temporal trends in phytoplankton species composition, phytoplankton abundance, biomass as well as the intensity and occurrence of blooms
              - to describe the spatial distribution of phytoplankton species
              - to identify key phytoplankton species (e.g. dominating, harmful, potential non-indigenous and/or invasive species, as well as indicator species)
              - to provide basic data for complex ecosystem analyses, food web studies, modelling as well as political and social requirements such as indicators in the frame of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive of the European Union (MSFD; European Union 2008) and the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD; European Union 2000) (HELCOM COMBINE Manual https://www.helcom.fi/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Guidelines-for-monitoring-phytoplankton-species-composition-abundance-and-biomass.pdf) "

        sampling:
            description: "For the purpose of quantitative studies in the open sea, the minimum requirement is to take an integrated sample from 0 to 10 m depth using a hose (Lindahl 1986) or by pooling equal amounts of water collected from fixed depths between 0 and 10 m using a water sampler (see Majaneva et al. 2009 for examples). The recommended sampling depths are 0 � 1 m, 2.5 m, 5 m, 7.5 m and 10 m. [�] It is recommended to take additional net samples from the water column (e.g. from 0 to 20 m) in order to obtain concentrated phytoplankton samples.
